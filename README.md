# Sos
In this project, we aim to build a customized, cost-efficient version of the SOS button, which is stealthy and uses the best-in-class GSM-GPS modules

This Smart SOS Device is a wearable safety and alarm device that can be operated easily, especially by children and senior citizens when in distress. It may come in handy as the world is constantly witnessing an increase in the number of criminal activities. Senior citizens living alone are vulnerable to panic situations due to safety reasons or, sometimes, a medical condition.

This  secret device  lets the user send an SOS alert to quickly communicate for help from a trusted person by using GSM, GPS, or GPRS. Through this device the person  not only gets alert with location of a insecure person but also can hear the conversation happening in the other side which helps him know the location/situation of his unsecure friend/family
